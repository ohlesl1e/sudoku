# sudoku
A demonstration of using breadth first search and depth first search to solve a sudoku puzzle.

I took on this project to investigate the different between BFS and DFS in certain situation.

The program will show that DFS is much better in the case of solving sudoku puzzle, because the end state is at the bottom of the tree.

I give credit to UC Berkley for util.py. I borrowed stack and queue from there.

### How to run
Put your sudoku puzzle in gameGrid in __main__ of game.py

Then run game.py to solve the puzzle.
